<h2 align="center"> Project Overview</h2>

<p align="center">
  This repository contains a diverse collection of interactive web
  projects developed using <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>.
</p>

<p align="center">
  The projects include browser-based games, animations, and utility
  applications that demonstrate real-world usage of JavaScript for
  user interaction and dynamic UI updates.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Each project is organized in its own folder and can be run
  independently in the browser without any external dependencies.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Key characteristics of the projects:
</p>

<p align="center">
  • Interactive gameplay and user input handling<br/>
  • DOM manipulation and event-driven logic<br/>
  • CSS-based animations and visual effects<br/>
  • Clean separation of structure, style, and behavior<br/>
  • Beginner-to-intermediate level frontend implementations
</p>

<p align="center">
  Together, these projects demonstrate a practical understanding of
  building complete frontend applications using core web technologies.
</p>

<h2 align="center"> Technology Stack</h2>

<p align="center">
  All projects in this repository are built using core web technologies
  that form the foundation of modern frontend development.
</p>

</p>

<p align="center">
  • <b>HTML</b> is used to create the structure and layout of each project<br/>
  • <b>CSS</b> is used for styling, animations, and visual presentation<br/>
  • <b>JavaScript</b> is used to handle logic, interactivity, and user events
</p>

<p align="center">
  No external libraries or frameworks are used.  
  This ensures a strong focus on understanding core concepts such as
  DOM manipulation, event handling, and browser-based logic.

<h2 align="center"> JavaScript Execution & Interaction Flowchart</h2>

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/gavneet0030/HTML-CSS-JS-PROJECT/blob/main/js%20chart/js%20chart.png"
       alt="JavaScript Execution Flowchart"
       width="80%" />
</p>

<p align="center">
  The above flowchart represents how <b>JavaScript</b> works in conjunction
  with HTML and CSS to create interactive and dynamic web applications.
</p>

<p align="center">
  This execution flow is followed by all projects in this repository,
  including games, animations, and utility-based applications.
</p>

<p align="center">
  • JavaScript file is loaded after the HTML and CSS are rendered<br/>
  • DOM elements are accessed using JavaScript selectors<br/>
  • Event listeners are attached to buttons, keys, or user actions<br/>
  • User interactions trigger JavaScript functions<br/>
  • Game logic, calculations, or animations are executed<br/>
  • DOM is updated dynamically based on the logic<br/>
  • Updated UI is reflected instantly on the screen
</p>

<p align="center">
  This flowchart helps in understanding how JavaScript controls behavior,
  user interaction, and real-time updates in browser-based projects.
